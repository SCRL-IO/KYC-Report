On the latest announcement, We have consulted with the Big Eyes team and have come to the conclusion that there was no foul play. They have been very helpful with other queries we asked and we both feel it is best that Big Eyes moves to use other KYC companies to increase their credibility. We feel that the participant's in the Big Eye project still put their trust in the project and do not feel that this is anything harmful.
